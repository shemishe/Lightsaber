# Lightsaber

Lightsaber is an iOS motion gesture app, a throwback to the early iPhone days and the single color lightsaber apps. I was inspired by such apps and decided to try my hand at coding my own virtual lightsaber. The lightsaber opens with a tap of a button, and lightsaber sound effects are played with each swing of your iPhone. The app currently features two lightsabers, Luke Skywalker's and Darth Vader's.

I am really happy with this project, however, it is not at its final version as I plan to add a variety of lightsabers. Lightsaber was my second app using the MVC pattern, as I wanted to continue practicing and challenging my skills with the MVC architecure pattern. Lightsaber really cemented the MVC pattern into my coding habits, to which I feel very proud of. Additionally, Lightsaber utilizes Auto Layout (no storyboard) for UI design, UIView animations, and UIEvent motion gestures.
